# Final Project - E-levate
## This project was originally created as an excersice for learning web developmenet technologies

For the last few decades the world has been struggling with educational systmes, either due to financial reasons, geographical reasons or even personal reasons. Some platforms took initiative into trying to bring education to the people at their own comfort and pace by creating E-learning platforms. 

I used many of the E-learning platforms to understand and learn lots of different subjects which inspired me to try and create something simliar. 

The project is still a work in progress, as there are lots of functionalities that needs to be added.
